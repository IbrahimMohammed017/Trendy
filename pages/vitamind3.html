            It's a fat-soluble vitamin that has long been known to help the body absorb and retain calcium and
            phosphorus, both are
            critical for building bone.
          </p>
          <p data-lang="vp2">
            Also, laboratory studies show that vitamin D can reduce cancer cell growth, help control infections and
            reduce
            inflammation.
          </p>
          <p data-lang="vp3">
            Many of the body’s organs and tissues have receptors for vitamin D, which suggest important roles beyond
            bone health,
            and scientists are actively investigating other possible functions.
          </p>
          <p data-lang="vp4">
            Few foods naturally contain vitamin D, though some foods are fortified with the vitamin.
          </p>
          <p data-lang="vp5">
            For most people, the best way to get enough vitamin D is taking a supplement because it is hard to eat
            enough through
            food.
          </p>
          <p data-lang="vp6">
            Vitamin D supplements are available in two forms: vitamin D2 (“ergocalciferol” or pre-vitamin D) and vitamin
            D3
            (“cholecalciferol”).
          </p>
          <p data-lang="vp7">
            Both are also naturally occurring forms that are produced in the presence of the sun’s ultraviolet-B (UVB)
            rays, hence
            its nickname, “the sunshine vitamin,” but D2 is produced in plants and fungi and D3 in animals, including
            humans.

                years it is 800 IU daily, This is for individuals with normal level of vitamin D.

                An estimated 1 billion people have inadequate levels of vitamin D in their blood, and deficiencies can

                In industrialized countries, doctors are seeing the resurgence of rickets, the bone-weakening disease
                that had been
                largely eradicated through vitamin D fortification.

              <p data-lang="vp11">
                The Institute of Medicine (IOM) released in November 2010 recommendations increasing the daily vitamin D

                  Some studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation in certain amounts may prevent such fractures.

                <p data-lang="vp16">
                  12 randomized controlled trials that included more than 42,000 people 65+ years of age, most of them
                  women, looked at
                  vitamin D supplementation with or without calcium, and with calcium or a placebo.

                <p data-lang="vp17">
                  Researchers found that higher intakes of vitamin D supplements - about 500-800 IU per day - reduced
                  hip and non-spine
                  fractures by about 20%, while lower intakes (400 IU or less) failed to offer any fracture prevention
                  benefit.

                <p data-lang="vp18">
                  Vitamin D may help increase muscle strength by preserving muscle fibers, which in turn helps to
                  prevent falls, a common
                  problem that leads to substantial disability and death in older people.
                </p>
                <p data-lang="vp19">
                  A combined analysis of multiple studies found that taking 700 to 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day lowered
                  the risk of falls
                  by 19%, but taking 200 to 600 IU per day did not offer any such protection.

                Vitamin D toxicity most often occurs from taking uncontrolled doses of supplements.

                The low amounts of the vitamin found in food are unlikely to reach a toxic level, and a high amount of
                sun exposure does
                not lead to toxicity because excess heat on the skin prevents D3 from forming.
